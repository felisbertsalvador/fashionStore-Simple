            <p class="head-text">Have you ever wished you could just make something appear? You know, some cough drops when you’re sick. That comfy chair you were eyeing at the mall. A pair of jeans to wear out tonight. Some delicious take-out food that won’t deliver. If only there were a pick-up and delivery service that could make your wish a reality. You’re in luck. Enter Taskers. They'll run all of your errands and deliver everything straight to your door.</p>
